# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: December 28th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the jQuery unit on Free Code Camp and completed a few exercises in the Data Structures unit. Made a schedule for the next 100 days using Nick Scialli's timeboxing approach. https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-100daysofcode-timeboxed-front-end-development-curriculum-cb4b6c2081c2 
Completed one exercise in Code Wars which feels like a total TRIUMPH. 

**Thoughts** Feeling good today, was able to put in a lot of hours.
